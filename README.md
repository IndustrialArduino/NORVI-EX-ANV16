# NORVI-EX-ANV16
16 Channel Analog Input expansion with True Differential Inputs.
 
NORVI is always about connectivity and expandability. This is the time to make use of the Expansion port of NORVI Controllers. 
The series of expansion modules connect to NORVI IoT controllers via its I2C and UART connections. 
You can add more features to the NORVI Controller without huge customizations. 
NORVI provides true technology with reliability for industrial applications being the world's IoT hardware manufacturer.
